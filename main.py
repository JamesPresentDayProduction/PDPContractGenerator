    Hey James!

    You'll want to run this in a commandline terminal like Terminal on your Mac using:
        python3 ./main.py

    You'll want to add in the details I've highlighted with comments '##' to make it work for you.

    You will also want to pip install numpy [pip3 install numpy] & docx [pip3 install python-docx] if you haven't already
    before running.

    If you have any questions or any issues with the code, please let me know :)
